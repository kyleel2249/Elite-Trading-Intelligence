# ETI — Elite Trading Intelligence

ETI Cloudflare-native edge dashboard for live public market data.

## Cloudflare-only deployment

This deployment serves the ETI dashboard and health APIs directly from a Cloudflare Worker.
It does not require a FastAPI origin, Fly.io, Docker hosting, a VPS, or `BACKEND_URL`.

### Cloudflare Workers Builds

Connect this GitHub repository to Cloudflare Workers Builds and configure:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Root directory | `/` |
| Build command | `npm install` |
| Deploy command | `npx wrangler deploy` |
| Entry point | `worker/index.ts` |

Use the Cloudflare Workers Free plan. Ensure the workers.dev subdomain is enabled.

### GitHub Actions deployment

Add these repository Actions secrets:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — token with permission to deploy Workers.
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` — your Cloudflare account ID.

Push to `main` or manually run **Deploy ETI to Cloudflare Workers**.

### Local development and checks

```bash
npm install
npm run check:worker
npm run dev
```

### Health checks

```bash
curl https://<worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev/__eti/status
curl https://<worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev/api/system/health
curl https://<worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev/api/market/providers
```

The health endpoint should report `status: ok` and `backend_required: false`.

## Live market dashboard

The Worker serves:

- Live candlestick chart and selectable intervals.
- Order-book bid/ask depth and spread.
- Cumulative visible market depth.
- Recent executed trades with timestamps and side.
- Connection status and update timestamps.

The current market-data adapter uses Binance's public REST API for initial snapshots and
public WebSocket streams for live updates. It is read-only and does not require exchange
credentials. Exchange connectivity, browser networking, public API limits and stream
availability apply. The interface must not represent stale or disconnected data as live.

## Important feature boundary

This Cloudflare edge deployment is a working market dashboard foundation, not a completed
port of every legacy Python/FastAPI subsystem. Existing investor disclosure monitoring,
Quiver Quant, Liquid API, research workflows, persistent portfolios, background jobs and
authenticated order execution must be migrated separately into Cloudflare-compatible
services and individually tested before being advertised as available.

Persistent ingestion and always-on jobs must be designed against actual Workers Free plan
limits. Do not silently rely on paid Workers features, Containers, or an external host.

## Security

- Public market feeds are read-only.
- Do not expose API keys, broker credentials, Quiver tokens or Liquid API tokens in frontend
  JavaScript or public environment variables.
- Withdrawal permissions must never be requested, stored or enabled.
- Live trading remains disabled unless a separate authenticated and risk-gated execution
  implementation is explicitly deployed and tested.
